- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehays619.
- 👀 I’m interested in street culture, skateboarding, punk, electronic, funk, hip-hop, DIY fashion, books (audio and written down on paper), genealogy (My grandfather fought in the Korean War and he was already old as fuck), beginner level fatherhood
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wordpress, mas mejor Spanish, empathy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the next big thing, maybe a shitcoin.
- 📫 How to reach me- even though I know how very far apart we are, it helps to think we might be wishing on that same bright star. Also at (619)559-9539.

Ok here goes... The 619 represents San Diego. San Diego split into 619 and 858 area codes, creating the second most tattooed number in San Diego. I’m also the 619th ehays.

Street culture- drugs, gangs, vice. Pre-Sheckler skateboarding, Bones Brigade, Bad Religion, NOFX, Lagwagon, The Floozies, Griz, Wu-Tang, The Pharcyde, phenomenology, The Hepatitis Bathtub, Harry Hays, happy and you know it? Clap your hands. Clap. Clap.

Not really learning it yet. But I spent $5 for the package above free. After two years in Mexico, my language skills have actually deteriorated. Didn’t think that was possible. Oh, fuck off!!! Dammit, let me try that again.

Maybe like one based on a dog that makes you see it’s asshole, like it or not. Hopefully not.

That song peaked at #42 on the Billboard 200. Are you fucking kidding me? That song is as close to perfect as was ever written. Listen to the guitar solo and tell me that’s not a  #1 on the Billboard 200 caliber song. The people who were around when this song came out had shit for brains. Ronstadt and Ingram, doing the goddamn thing. Fucking #42. Outrageous.

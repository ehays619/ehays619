- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehays619.
- 👀 I’m interested in street culture, skateboarding, punk, electronic, funk, hip-hop, DIY fashion, books (audio and written down on paper), genealogy (My grandfather fought in the Korean War and he was already old as fuck), beginner level fatherhood
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wordpress, mas mejor Spanish, empathy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the next big thing, maybe a shitcoin.
- 📫 How to reach me- even though I know how very far apart we are, it helps to think we might be wishing on that same bright star. Also at (619)559-9539.

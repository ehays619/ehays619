Add an additional extension-

Ok here goes... The 619 represents San Diego. San Diego split into 619 and 858 area codes in 1999. 858 extends north from the San Diego beach communities into La Jolla, Del Mar and Solana Beach, and inland to Rancho Santa Fe, Rancho Bernardo and Poway, and created the second most tattooed number in San Diego. I’m also the 619th ehays.

Street culture- drugs, gangs, org. crime, vice. Pre-Sheckler skateboarding, Bones Brigade, Bad Religion, NOFX, Lagwagon, Social D, The Floozies, Griz, Wu-Tang, The Pharcyde, phenomenology, The Hepatitis Bathtub, Harry Hays, happy and you know it? Clap your hands. Clap. Clap.

Not really learning it yet. But I spent $5 for the package above free. After two years in Mexico, my language skills have actually deteriorated. Didn’t think that was possible. Oh, fuck off!!! Dammit, let me try that again.

Like a new shitcoin. Maybe like one based on a dog that makes you see it’s asshole, like it or not. Hopefully not.

That song peaked at #42 on the Billboard 200. Are you fucking kidding me? That song is as close to perfect as was ever written. Listen to the guitar solo and tell me that’s not a  #1 on the Billboard 200 caliber song. The people who were around when this song came out had shit for brains. Ronstadt and Ingram, doing the goddamn thing with James "Titanic" Horner on the keys. Fucking #42. Outrageous. 

Gotta be honest with you though. I thought it was Aaron Neville all these years. I lost a lot of good friends over the years arguing this point. They're like "let it go, who fucking cares!?!" And I'm like, "then just say it was Aaron Neville you lying piece of shit. Ingram couldn't handle this song, and you fucking know that!!!" Honest mistake though, that part at 3:19, where Ingram goes "Can see us...", I mean, that's classic Neville. 
And they both have voices that make grown men weep. Crying gets the sad out of your eyes.
